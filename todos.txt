Replace disk uploads with S3 or GCS + signed uploads. I can implement an endpoint that returns a signed URL for direct client upload so the server doesn't proxy file bytes.


Avoid GET for State-Changing Requests: Sensitive actions should not use GET requests, as these can be easily exploited via malicious URLs
1. Cookie security considerations:


-------->>>>>>>>>>authmiddleware: 

You’re parsing the cookie manually from the cookie header string.

Recommendation: Use a dedicated cookie parsing middleware like cookie-parser
 in Express to avoid parsing mistakes and edge cases.

Make sure the session cookie is:

HttpOnly: prevents JavaScript access.

Secure: only sent over HTTPS.

SameSite: set to Strict or Lax to prevent CSRF.

Use AsyncLocalStorage for automatic context propagation

One of the best modern ways to keep context for each request, even through async calls, is Node.js’s built-in AsyncLocalStorage (available since Node 12+).

Example:

const { AsyncLocalStorage } = require('async_hooks');
const asyncLocalStorage = new AsyncLocalStorage();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  asyncLocalStorage.run(new Map(), () => {
    asyncLocalStorage.getStore().set('requestId', req.id);
    next();
  });
});

function log(message) {
  const store = asyncLocalStorage.getStore();
  const requestId = store ? store.get('requestId') : 'no-request-id';
  console.log(`[${requestId}] ${message}`);
}


Now any code within the request lifecycle can call log() and it will automatically include the right requestId without passing it explicitly.
