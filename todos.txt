Replace disk uploads with S3 or GCS + signed uploads. I can implement an endpoint that returns a signed URL for direct client upload so the server doesn't proxy file bytes.

Avoid GET for State-Changing Requests: Sensitive actions should not use GET requests, as these can be easily exploited via malicious URLs
1. Cookie security considerations:


authmiddleware: 
Youâ€™re parsing the cookie manually from the cookie header string.

Recommendation: Use a dedicated cookie parsing middleware like cookie-parser
 in Express to avoid parsing mistakes and edge cases.

Make sure the session cookie is:

HttpOnly: prevents JavaScript access.

Secure: only sent over HTTPS.

SameSite: set to Strict or Lax to prevent CSRF.
